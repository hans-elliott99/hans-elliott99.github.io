# Recent Projects
#### Mass Mobilization Data Analysis (Causal Inference)
Did you know that when state governments choose to respond with force to protests, they increase the likelihood that future protesters use violence?

#### Machine Learning
[Predicting the Punctuality of Zürich Transit](https://www.kaggle.com/hanselliott/predicting-the-punctuality-of-zurich-transit).  
In this project we train regression and calssification models to predict the punctuality of tram rides in the Zürich pubic transit network. We believe that providing public transit riders with accurate predictions of arrival times can reduce hidden costs and increase use.
