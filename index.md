### Hello!
Thanks for checking out my website. I am always grateful to connect with new people and appreciate you taking the time to see what I've been up to.    

### About Me
- I am a master's student studying economics, interested in applications of data science, econometrics, and machine learning to environmental issues. I believe that data science has a vital role to play in mitigating climate change particularly in the tracking, measurement, and evaluation of humanity’s impact on the environment.  
- I am currently looking for opportunities related to data science, quantitative policy research, and computational social science.    
- I enjoy developing my data science skills and am eager to learn more about statistics and computer science.

# Recent Projects  
#### Machine Learning
[Deep learning from scratch in base R](https://etatxd-hans0elliott.shinyapps.io/shiny/).   
To better understand deep learning, I am working on building a package of neural network functions from "scratch." [Old blogpost](https://hans-elliott99.github.io/nnfs-r/blogpost-1/nnfs-blogpost.html).  

[Herbarium 2022: Plant Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hanselliott/herbarium22-cnn-wandb).  
Used Python to import plant images, apply preprocessing, and create/train a Convolutional Neural Network (using Keras + TensorFlow). This notebook also demonstrates how to integrate `Weights & Biases` into deep learning code to track model performance and tuning. [Also deployed a trained model as a web app](https://hans-elliott99-herb22-streamlitapp-b28rg7.streamlitapp.com/).  

[Predicting the Punctuality of Zürich Transit](https://www.kaggle.com/hanselliott/predicting-the-punctuality-of-zurich-transit).  
In this project we train regression and classification models to predict the punctuality of tram rides in the Zürich pubic transit network. We believe that providing public transit riders with accurate predictions of arrival times can reduce hidden costs and increase use.  
Also see our [public Kaggle dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/hanselliott/a-week-of-zurich-transit)

#### Causal Inference
_Regression Discontinuity Replication:_ "New evidence on the impact of sustained exposure to air pollution on life expectancy 
from China’s Huai River Policy" (Ebenstein et al., 2017).  
[Code](https://hans-elliott99.github.io/causal-inf/huai-river/rdd-huai-river.html). [Write-up](https://hans-elliott99.github.io/causal-inf/huai-river/huai-river.pdf).

#### Data Analysis
[Anti-State Protests: A Statistical Analysis](https://hans-elliott99.github.io/protest/MassMobilBlogPost.html).   
Did you know that when state governments choose to respond with force to protests, they may increase the likelihood that future protesters use violence?  
In this project, I use visualizations and linear probability models to analyze a panel dataset of anti-state protests from around the world.

#### Sustainable Development
_Avoid-Shift-Improve: The Role of Demand-Side Solutions in the Sustainable Development of Transportation._  
[An essay.](https://hans-elliott99.github.io/loose-pdfs/ASI_Elliott.pdf)

#### GIS Work

[Oregon Climate Change Project](https://hans-elliott99.github.io/GIS/GIS_I_Project.html)  
[C(art)ograhpy](https://hans-elliott99.github.io/GIS/C-art-ography.html)  

#### Undergraduate Thesis
_Aligning Oregon's Higher Education with a Changing Labor Market: Job Polarization and the Evolving Role of the Community College_  

An undergraduate economics thesis about the Oregon labor market and community colleges. Successfully defended in June 2021.
