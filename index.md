- I am currently looking for opportunities related to applied economic research, and hope to use econometric & data science methods to learn about our world.
- I enjoy developing my data science skills, and am eager to learn more about statistics and quantitative social science.

# Recent Projects  
#### Machine Learning
[Predicting the Punctuality of Zürich Transit](https://www.kaggle.com/hanselliott/predicting-the-punctuality-of-zurich-transit).  
In this project we train regression and classification models to predict the punctuality of tram rides in the Zürich pubic transit network. We believe that providing public transit riders with accurate predictions of arrival times can reduce hidden costs and increase use. 


#### Data Analysis
[Anti-State Protests: A Statistical Analysis](https://hans-elliott99.github.io/protest/MassMobilBlogPost.html).   
Did you know that when state governments choose to respond with force to protests, they may increase the likelihood that future protesters use violence?  
In this project, I use visualizations and linear probability models to analyze a panel dataset of anti-state protests from around the world.
