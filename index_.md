### Hello
Thanks for checking out my website!  
I upload projects here if I think they may be worth sharing or if they need a home on the internet. Please feel free to provide feedback or suggestions.  

### About Me
- I recently graduated from a master's program in economics, and I am interested in applications of data science, statistics, and machine learning to social science research.  
- I like to work on programming and data science projects. In my spare time I enjoy learning about and training neural networks. Someday I'd like to work on projects that use unstructured data to investigate society and policy.

# Recent Projects  
**[Image Color Palette Extractor](https://image-color-palette.hans-elliott99.repl.co/)**  
Convert an image to an RGB color palette.   

**[World Cup 2022 Simulation](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hanselliott/wc22-xgboost-simulation)**  
I use historical data to fit a model which predicts result probabilities for a specific national-team matchup based on past matchup results, recent team performance, and FIFA ranking. Then I iteratively sample results from the probabilities and repeatedly fill out a bracket, saving the most common results over several thousand iterations.  

**[Toxic/Rash Plant Classification](https://hans-elliott99-toxic-plant-classification-streamlitapp-egloqy.streamlitapp.com/)**  
Used Python to [webscrape](https://github.com/hans-elliott99/toxic-plant-classification/blob/main/notebooks/scrape-iNaturalist.ipynb) an original dataset (now [available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hanselliott/toxic-plant-classification)) of common North American rash plants. Then used transfer learning [to train a deep computer vision model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hanselliott/tpc-basicresnet) which can classify plant images as either toxic or nontoxic with 86% test accuracy. This was a difficult task given its 'fine-grained' nature (differentiating between hard-to-distinguish object classes).  


**Deep learning from scratch**     
A basic neutral network package built in R. [Shiny demo](https://etatxd-hans0elliott.shinyapps.io/shiny/). [Old blogpost](https://hans-elliott99.github.io/nnfs-r/blogpost-1/nnfs-blogpost.html).  
A basic neural network built with the C++ standard library. [GitHub](https://github.com/hans-elliott99/CppNet).


**[Predicting the Punctuality of Zürich Transit](https://www.kaggle.com/hanselliott/predicting-the-punctuality-of-zurich-transit)**  
In this project we train regression and classification models to predict the punctuality of tram rides in the Zürich pubic transit network. We believe that providing public transit riders with accurate predictions of arrival times can reduce hidden costs and increase use.  
Also see our [public Kaggle dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/hanselliott/a-week-of-zurich-transit)

_Regression Discontinuity Replication:_ "New evidence on the impact of sustained exposure to air pollution on life expectancy 
from China’s Huai River Policy" (Ebenstein et al., 2017).  
[Code](https://hans-elliott99.github.io/causal-inf/huai-river/rdd-huai-river.html). [Write-up](https://hans-elliott99.github.io/causal-inf/huai-river/huai-river.pdf).

[Anti-State Protests: A Statistical Analysis](https://hans-elliott99.github.io/protest/MassMobilBlogPost.html).   
When state governments choose to respond with force to protests, they may increase the likelihood that future protesters use violence. 
In this project, I use visualizations and linear probability models to analyze a panel dataset of anti-state protests from around the world.

_Avoid-Shift-Improve: The Role of Demand-Side Solutions in the Sustainable Development of Transportation._  
[An essay.](https://hans-elliott99.github.io/loose-pdfs/ASI_Elliott.pdf)

[Premier League Geospatial History - Web Map](https://hans-elliott99.github.io/GIS/PLHistoryPost.html)  
[Oregon Climate Change Project](https://hans-elliott99.github.io/GIS/GIS_I_Project.html)  
[C(art)ograhpy](https://hans-elliott99.github.io/GIS/C-art-ography.html)  

_Aligning Oregon's Higher Education with a Changing Labor Market: Job Polarization and the Evolving Role of the Community College_  

An undergraduate economics thesis about the Oregon labor market and community colleges. Successfully defended in June 2021.
