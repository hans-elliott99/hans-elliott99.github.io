Exploring digital cartography as a creative outlet and to gain experience with relevant software.

## Blender Shaded Relief Maps
Inspired by folks like [Daniel Huffman](https://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com/) and [Scott Reinhard](https://scottreinhard.com/) who are bringing old topo maps to life using digital elevation models.  

Rather than creating a hillshade in a GIS program, Blender can be used to create more aesthetically pleasing hillshades. I use ArcGIS Pro for data gathering & reprojection, Blender to create a 3d model of the terrain and simulate a hillshade, and Adobe Photoshop for combining the hillshade with the old topo maps. Still a lot to learn and improve upon, but I enjoy learning new programs and this was a good excuse to get my feet wet in Blender.

Turns out it's a rather flat chunk of the Earth. Topo map from [USGS historical topo collection](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/national-geospatial-program/historical-topographic-maps-preserving-past).

## Bay Area Land Cover Map Poster
Made in the style of a WPA poster. ArcGIS Pro and Photoshop. Inspired by [John Nelson](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/author/j_nelson/).
