### Sources
I created this data by scraping Wikipedia's records of each PL season. The final data set will be uploaded to my GitHub. Most historical information also came from Wikipedia.  
The map content was created with ArcGIS Pro, and the web map experience with ArcGIS Online. I created my own [Premier League style](https://uo-online.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=beb490f999f9435a91de66aa893d332b) to use team crests. This is now public through ESRI for use by anyone.
