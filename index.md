### Hello!
Thanks for checking out my website. I am always grateful to connect with new people and appreciate you taking the time to see what I've been up to.    

### About Me
- I am a master's student studying economics, interested in applied micro, econometrics, and machine learning. I hope to apply these skills to the study of humans and our interactions with the natural environment.    
- I am currently looking for opportunities related to applied economic research, computational social science, and data science.  
- I enjoy developing my data science skills, and am eager to learn more about statistics, quantitative methods, and computer science.

# Recent Projects  
#### Machine Learning
[Deep learning from scratch in base R](https://hans-elliott99.github.io/nnfs-r/blogpost-1/nnfs-blogpost.html).   
To better understand deep learning, I am working on building a package of neural network functions from "scratch." This blogpost covers my recent progress.   

[Predicting the Punctuality of Zürich Transit](https://www.kaggle.com/hanselliott/predicting-the-punctuality-of-zurich-transit).  
In this project we train regression and classification models to predict the punctuality of tram rides in the Zürich pubic transit network. We believe that providing public transit riders with accurate predictions of arrival times can reduce hidden costs and increase use.  
Also see our [public Kaggle dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/hanselliott/a-week-of-zurich-transit)


#### Data Analysis
[Anti-State Protests: A Statistical Analysis](https://hans-elliott99.github.io/protest/MassMobilBlogPost.html).   
Did you know that when state governments choose to respond with force to protests, they may increase the likelihood that future protesters use violence?  
In this project, I use visualizations and linear probability models to analyze a panel dataset of anti-state protests from around the world.
